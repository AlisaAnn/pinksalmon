In Catch_Data.csv and Sites.csv, the RMD code uses the fields that contain "dx" and "dy" offset coordinates for label/pie placement relative to site locations. The dx/dy fields with NO "_m" were used to create the original 2-bar chart and the units are degrees. The dx and dy fields that also contain a "_m" are used for the pie-chart figure (units in meters). The ones that have "bar" in them refer to the offset for the chart graphic (bar or pie). Note that in Catch_Data.csv, the offsets need to be changed for both years (and likewise, can be different for the 2 years if needed).
